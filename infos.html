    <p><b>Sleep Hygiene and its Role in Mental Health</b>
    <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">What is Sleep Hygiene?</b> 
    <br><p style="text-indent:25px;">Sleep hygiene is about having healthy habits that promote consistent and quality sleep. This includes maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and creating a restful environment.Sleep is like a reset button for our brain. Getting a good rest, ensures that we wake up feeling refreshed, focused and ready to take on the day. Have you ever tried pulling an all-nighter and then functioning like a normal person the next day? Yeah it doesn't work like that. Getting a good sleep helps us to be sharp, helps you manage stress and improve your mood. Having poor sleep hygiene can negatively affect both sleep quality and quantity.</p>
    <p style="text-indent:25px;">This is not just about how many hours you sleep but it is also about how well you sleep. Skipping sleep to give yourself more study time sounds like a small thing, but the truth is: Bad sleep = bad everything. A good sleep hygiene means having both a bedroom environment and daily routine that promotes consistent and uninterrupted sleep.</p></p>
    
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">When pulling an all-nighter, have you ever felt 10x more stressful the next day? That is because of your poor sleep that messes up your brain's ability to regulate emotions. It has been found that sleep disruptions alter brain chemistry, which can lead to the development of mental health disorder.</p>
    <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">Is your sleep hygiene in trouble?</b>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><b>Tossing and turning all night.</b> Staring at the ceiling or just lying in bed. If it takes you more than 30 minutes to fall asleep, that's a red flag!</li>
      <li><b>Daytime sleepiness.</b>If you feel like you're constantly fighting to stay awake during the day, this means that your body isn’t getting enough sleep that it needs.</li>
      <li><b>Waking up feeling totally tired.</b>This also happens when your sleep cycle is disrupted, this means that you don’t get enough sleep.</li>
      <li><b>itting snooze more than 10 times.</b> <i>Just five more minutes...</i> If you’re struggling to wake up, this means that your body is not properly refreshed. This could mean that you sleep or take a rest at the wrong hour or you just don’t get a quality sleep.</li>
      <li><b>You rely on caffeine and naps to function.</b>If drinking coffee, energy drinks and taking a power nap is the only way for you to function, it’s a sign that your sleep is not doing its job.</li>
      <li><b>You feel moody, anxious or stuck in a brain fog.</b>Taking a proper sleep is important for emotional regulation. A poor sleep doesn't just tire you out, this also messes with your emotion, mental health and focus. If you ever feel easily irritated or struggle to concentrate, the reason behind this could be lack of sleep.</li>
    </ol>
    <i>If these seem familiar to you, then don’t worry we can help you fix your sleep habit. Just keep reading to find out!
    </i></p>
    <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">How can you improve your sleep hygiene?</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Set your sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday. This will help in regulating your body clock, making it easier for you to fall asleep and wake up.</li>
      <li>Follow a nightly routine. Keep the routine consistent, this will help your body to recognize that it’s bedtime when you start the routine. Your routine can include whatever that makes you feel relaxed, here are some examples:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Taking a warm bath. The water from the shower can be relaxing but the drop in the body temperature as you cool down can help you feel sleepy.</li>
          <li>Try doing stretches to help your muscles relax and release some tension.</li>
          <li>You can also try meditating to help your mind and body to be calm.</li>
          <li>Give yourself at least 30 minutes to read a book.</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Refrain from using digital devices one to two hours before bedtime. These devices emit blue light, this reduces the melatonin levels in your body. It  tricks your brain that it’s still daytime, which makes it hard for you to fall asleep.</li>
      <li>Exercise regularly. You can exercise as little as 30 minutes a day. You can try aerobic exercises to improve your sleep quality and overall health. You can do it indoors or even outdoors. Remember to avoid exercising when it's near your bedtime.</li>
      <li>Limit your caffeine intake. The effects of caffeine inside your body can last for 3-7 hours after consuming it. The afternoon coffee you took might keep you up at night.</li>
      <li>Make sure that your sleep environment works for you. Your bedroom should make you feel comfortable and relaxed. Too much noise or a bright environment can make it hard for you to fully rest.</li>
      <li>Limit napping. Naps are amazing to recharge yourself for a few minutes. But a long and late nap can mess up your body clock. If you need to take a nap you should keep it to 20 minutes or less.</li>
      <li>Minimize light. Bright lights can trick your brain and keep you awake.  When it’s dark tour brain produces melatonin, this is a hormone which makes you feel sleepy. But when you’re exposed to bright light, your brain will think that it's still daytime. If you’re someone who can’t sleep without any lights, you can try switching to a warm-dim light.</li>
      <li>Don’t eat heavy meals before going to bed. Eating heavy meals before bedtime can affect you negatively. Consume meals at least three hours before your bedtime.</li>
    </ol>
    <i style="background-color: #c9bbf3;"> By following these tips, we hope that you can wake up feeling more energized, focused and ready to take on your day!

      <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">What is Procrastination?</b> </p>
      <p style="text-indent:25px;">The habit of delaying or postponing tasks is what we call Procrastination. It's putting off tasks which need to be done. It is the failure in self-regulation that can lead to acting irrationally. We delay things off, even when we know that we should be doing them. For example, instead of starting your essay that is due tomorrow, you decided to open Tiktok for a quick scroll—an hour later you find yourself panicking at midnight with nothing but a blank page.</p>
      <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">Why do we procrastinate?</b>
      <br><p style="text-indent: 25px;">Procrastination is more than a lack of time management skills. The tendency to procrastinate often comes from deeper issues. We often procrastinate when we find tasks most difficult, unpleasant or boring. Some common reasons for procrastination are the following:
      </span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Feeling bored</b>: There are times when you find an activity or a task boring and unpleasant, which is why you're far more likely to put it off until later. Our brain naturally looks for something more exciting. This is why scrolling through TikTok seems way more appealing than writing a research paper. </li>
        <li><b>Feeling overwhelmed</b>: There are times where tasks feel so overwhelming and complicated that we just end up avoiding it altogether. This feeling can be linked to a lack of energy, trying to do multiple things at once or being a perfectionist.</li>
        <li><b>Avoiding unpleasant feelings</b>: Humans tend to avoid things that make them feel bad. The pleasure-pain principle by Sigmund Freud suggests that we are more motivated to obtain pleasure and avoid pain. This shows that we humans tend to do things that give us instant satisfaction and gratification rather than the things that we find difficult, overwhelming or unpleasant. </li>
        <li><b>Fearing failure</b>: When we fear making mistakes we tend to avoid doing any important tasks. The more anxiety we feel about a task, the more likely we'll put it off later. </li>
        <li><b>Distraction</b>: Distractions in our surroundings prevents us from being able to focus on the task at hand. </li>
        <li><b>Lacking of belief in your abilities</b>: This is another reason why we tend to procrastinate. If you lack faith in your abilities, you're more likely to put it off. It is important for you to believe in yourself so you can carry out tasks efficiently. </li>
        <li><b>Adhering to bad habits</b>: Habits are hard to break and procrastination is considered as a habit. If you let yourself get used to waiting until the last minute to do your tasks, your brain will get used to keep on doing that. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">How to overcome Procrastination?</b>
        <br><b>STEP 1: Know yourself and find out 🕵️‍♂️</b> <br>
        Now that you know what's holding you back, you need to figure out how you work best. For this step imagine yourself as a detective investigating your own life. </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Spot the problem:</b> To overcome procrastination you need to understand the reasons why you procrastinate . To come up with an effective solution, you need to really understand the root of the problem. Self-awareness and self-knowledge is the key for you to figure out how to put an end to this bad habit.</li>
          <li><b>Where does your time really go?</b> Conduct  a time audit. This will help you track how you spend your day. You might think that you don't have enough time, but in reality you just managed it poorly. By conducting a time audit you will be able to expose hidden time-wasters. Track everything you do for a full day.</li>
          <li><b>Figure out your biggest time wasters:</b> We have different time wasters which consume our valuable time. It is important for you to be aware of what those time wasters are. Scrolling through the internet, watching TV, and playing online games are the well known time wasters. Once you know the time wasters that consume your time, you can use the right strategies to fight back.</li>
          <li><b>Find your most productive time:</b>  Some people work best at night, while others are productive at 5 am. By knowing what your best work time will help you create a schedule for tasks. Are you a Morning person? Or do you prefer to work during the evenings? Or maybe you’re a midday warrior? Take advantage of this energy and schedule your time as close to it as possible.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>STEP 2: Master your time ⏰</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>The Eisenhower Matrix:</b> This is a technique for organizing your tasks into four separate quadrants based on urgency and importance.</li>
          <b>How it works:</b>
          <ol type="a">
            <li><b>Important and Urgent</b> - Do it right away, these are tasks that has pressing deadlines.</li>
            <li><b>Important but not Urgent</b> - Decide when to do it, these tasks matter but they don't have an immediate deadline. Schedule this ahead of time so you won't have to do it last minute.</li>
            <li><b>Not important but urgent</b> - Delegate, these are tasks that is urgent but does not require you</li>
            <li><b>Not important and not urgent</b> - Delete, these are tasks that don't add any value and just consume your time.</li>
          </ol>
          <li><b>Eat the Frog:</b>This technique is developed by Brian Tracey. It is inspired from the quote misattributed to Mark Twain which says “if you eat a live frog first  thing in the morning, nothing worse will happen to you for the rest of the day”. This method involves starting your day by doing the most difficult task and getting them out of the way.</li>
          <b>How it works:</b>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Set a clear goal</li>
            <li>Write it down</li>
            <li>Compile a list of tasks that you need to accomplish</li>
            <li>Organize the list in order of priority. The “frogs” are the most important and most difficult tasks.</li>
            <li>Take action</li>
          </ol>
          <li><b>Pomodoro Technique:</b>	This technique was invented by Francesco Cirillo. If you are someone who has issues with multitasking, missed deadlines or even burnout, this method could be a good fit. This technique uses a timer to break down work intervals.</li>
          <b>How it works:</b>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Choose a task that you want to get done</li>
            <li>Set a timer for 25 minutes (or however long you want)</li>
            <li>Work on that task until your alarm sound</li>
            <li>Take a five minute break</li>
            <li>Repeat this process four times</li>
            <li>Take a longer break after the 4th pomodoro</li>
          </ol>
          <li><b>Time blocking:</b> This is a strategy that involves being aware of how you spend your time during the day.</li>
          <b>How it works:</b>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>Divide each 24-hour day into small blocks of time</li>
            <li>Estimate the amount of time that is required to each of the tasks and assign them into the time blocks in a planner or calendar. </li>
            <li>Add breaks between the start and the end of each tasks</li>
            <li>Work your way through the daily schedule</li>
            <li>You can adjust your schedule accordingly if certain tasks require more or less time.</li>
          </ol>
        </ol>

        <p><b>STEP 3: Plan out your time like a pro 📅</b>
        <br><span style="text-indent: 25px;">Planning your time doesn't mean overwhelming your schedule with endless tasks. It's about setting a clear system up. When you have a clear plan, you stop panicking at the last minute, avoid unnecessary stress and you'll go from “I don't have enough time” to “Wow, I still have time to relax.”</span>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Create a calendar:</b> This serves as your personal life GPS. You can keep track of your schedule and deadlines ahead of time. This is like having a personal assistant that reminds you about something important. Keep the calendar you created in a place where you can see it everyday, such as on top of your table beside your desk or it can be on your wall. But if you prefer a digital calendar, the first thing you need to do is to check it.</li>
          <li><b>Set reminders and deadlines:</b> After creating your calendar, you need to give yourself periodic reminders to be able to stay on track. It is important that you set and know deadlines. You can do these by setting an alarm on your phone or by writing it down.</li>
          <li><b>Use a to-do list:</b> This is one of the easy ways to prioritize. You can create a different to do list dedicated for different things such as daily to do or school to do. Write down the things you need to accomplish.</li>
          <li><b>Find tools that work best for you:</b> Different people focus in different ways. The tools that you use to keep your schedule organized must be the right fit for you. You can do it digitally or by having physical planners.</li>
          <li><b>Break down tasks into small pieces:</b> A task can seem so big that we dread doing it or we'll feel lost about how to start. All you have to do is divide it into mini-tasks. For example, instead of writing down a task “write and essay”, try “come up with outline ideas”, then “write introduction”. Small progress is progress. By doing this you can make something that may seem big into something manageable.</li>
        </ol>
      
        <p><b>STEP 4: Work smarter everyday! 🧠</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Trim your to do list:</b> Do not overwhelm yourself with 10+ tasks. You only have 24 hours in a day and if you find yourself having a long  list, then things might drop altogether. Remove anything that doesn't need to be done that day or that week. By doing these it can help you to make a list that is less overwhelming. Do this the day before so you are ready to focus and get started the next morning.</li>
          <li><b>Avoid multitasking:</b> Focus on one task at a time. Working with multiple tasks can be overwhelming and can result in mental overload. Doing too many tasks at the same time can affect your cognitive ability, which results in feeling unproductive or dissatisfied with the progress you make.</li>
          <li><b>Eliminate distractions:</b> Study in a quiet place. Make sure to limit distractions when you are working on completing a task. Put your phone away, and make sure that you're setting yourself up to succeeding in completing tasks.</li>
          <li><b>Manage environment:</b> Ensure that your workspace is comfortable and helps you to focus while you work. Your environment plays a huge role in your focus and productivity. </li>
        </ol>
      
        <p><b>STEP 5: Stay disciplined and focused 🎯</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Use rewards and incentives:</b> Just like the Pomodoro technique which allows you to reward yourself with a break, you can also use other rewards as a motivation. This is a great way for you to stay on track. It's much easier to focus on your tasks when you know that you have a reward to look forward to. Schedule activities that you enjoy as “rewards” for achieving your goals.</li>
          <li><b>Be realistic and flexible:</b> There are times when things won't go as planned, instead of giving up you just have to adjust. Your goal is to make progress, not perfection. Be patient with yourself when the things you planned out don't go exactly as planned.</li>
          <li><b>Make time for yourself:</b> Overworking yourself can lead to burnout. You have to ensure that you allocate time for yourself and your mental wellbeing. This helps maintain your work-life balance. Taking breaks doesn’t mean wasting time, it's about recharging your energy so you can work better.</li>
          <li><b>Ask for help when needed:</b> Don't be afraid to turn to other people for help. This is one of the smartest things you can do instead of struggling alone. By reaching out to those around you, it can reduce the stress and you'll be able to gain knowledge and help you learn faster. </li>
        </ol>

      <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">Handling Academic Pressure</b> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Handling Academic Pressure is a common problem that students at all educational levels encounter. Anxiety and tension can be greatly increased by the demanding requirements of schoolwork, tests, and extracurricular activities. Students can use a variety of tactics, including time management, asking for help from mentors and peers and engaging in mindfulness exercises to effectively handle this pressure. Effective time management has been shown to lower stress levels and enhance academic achievement. Building a solid support system can also offer students both practical help and emotional comfort, enabling them to handle their academic obligation more skillfully. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Students can develop resilience in the face of academic challenges by integrating mindfulness practices, like meditation and deep breathing exercises, into their daily routines. Research has shown that mindfulness can improve student focus, reduce anxiety, and improve overall well being. As Students become more skilled at managing their time and emotions, they are better prepared to succeed academically while maintaining their mental health.</p>
      <p style="color:#7f5af0"><b>How to deal with academic burnout?</b> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Academic burnout is a negative emotional, physical, and mental response to prolonged periods of studying, often leaving students feeling exhausted, frustrated, unmotivated, and less capable in the classroom. It typically results from years of continuous academic pressure or from intense weeks or months of study. </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Addressing academic burnout is very important and cannot be overstated. Aside from affecting a student's performance and engagement, burnout can also have long-term impacts on mental health and overall quality of life. If left unaddressed, it may lead to anxiety, depression, and a significant decline in academic performance, potentially triggering a vicious cycle that puts a student’s academic journey at risk.
        That’s why recognizing the signs of burnout and implementing effective prevention strategies is essential. Building resilience and fostering healthy coping mechanisms can help students not only adapt to but thrive within the demands of academic life.</p>
      <p><b>STEP 1: Give yourself time to rest</b>
      <br> For both general wellbeing and successful learning, sleep is essential. Your brain can assimilate and consolidate knowledge when you take breaks from studying, which lessens mental exhaustion and avoids burnout. Making rest a priority will improve focus and retention, when will ultimately result in more fruitful study sessions, whether it takes the form of brief breaks or lengthier downtime. Understanding the value of sleep helps you establish a long lasting study schedule achievement and individual well-being.
      </p>
      <p><b>STEP 2: Re-evaluate your study techniques + Plan your breaks</b>
        <br> Maximizing efficacy and efficiency requires evaluating and improving your study methods. Think about the strategies that have previously worked for you and pinpoint any areas that need improvement. Use active learning techniques including employing visual aids, teaching others, and summarizing facts. Furthermore, it's critical to schedule regular breaks because research indicates that doing so might enhance focus and memory of material. Effective study techniques and well planned breaks can be used to produce a well-rounded strategy that improves learning results.
      </p>
      <p><b>STEP 3: Focus on your progress and journey</b>
        <br>It's simple to get obsessed with grades or results, but changing your viewpoint to value your development and educational path will help you have a more optimistic outlook. Recognize the little triumphs and advancements you make along the path since they add to your total development. By placing a strong emphasis on the learning process, you can become more resilient and motivated and see obstacles as chances for personal growth. You develop a greater respect for learning and individual accomplishments by appreciating your journey rather than concentrating just on the final product.
      </p>
      <p><b>STEP 4: Learning is a process, stay kind to yourself and others</b>
      <br> A compassionate attitude toward oneself and others is fostered by acknowledging that learning is an ongoing process. Recognize that obstacles and setbacks are a normal part of learning, and that its important to practice self-compassion when things get tough. You may lessen anxiety and foster a more encouraging learning environment by being kind to yourself. Furthermore, showing people this kindness encourages empathy and teamwork, creating a positive environment where everyone can prosper. Adopting this perspective can improve peer interactions and your educational experience.

      <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">Building relationships with professors and classmates</b> </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Understand financial literacy basics like budgeting, managing your student loans, building credit, and navigating banking and credit card use. Learn how to stay financially responsible while still enjoying your college life.</p>
      <p><b>Financial Literacy and Budgeting Tools</b></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Financial literacy refers to the skills and knowledge needed to make smart decisions regarding your finances. It includes understanding how to earn money, budget effectively, manage loans and borrowing, plan your spending, and make sound investment choices. By improving your financial literacy, you'll be better equipped to manage your money, save more, reduce debt, and achieve your financial goals.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">For college students, developing financial literacy is especially valuable. It helps them navigate the challenges of managing student loans, budgeting for expenses, and planning for the future. With a solid understanding of personal finance, students can make wiser decisions about their money, avoid unnecessary debt, and set themselves up for financial success after graduation.</p>
      <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">Basics of Budgeting</b>
      <br style="text-indent: 25px;"> Creating and using a budget is something that can benefit everyone. Budgeting is a powerful tool that helps you develop a financial plan, enhancing your financial capability and giving you a sense of empowerment.</p>
      <p>Your perspective on budgeting plays a key role in your success with it. Some view budgets as restrictive, thinking they take the fun out of life and cause guilt over spending. Others may feel that budgeting is too time-consuming or difficult to stick to.</p>
      <p>However, budgeting is actually an empowering practice. It allows you to take control of your finances, ensuring your money is directed towards the things that matter most to you, including fun activities. With this mindset, taking the time to create a realistic budget that you can consistently follow will prove to be incredibly beneficial.</p>
      <p><b>What is a budget? What is the budgeting process?</b>
      <br> A budget is a written plan for how you'll manage and allocate your income each month, covering both your spending and saving. The budgeting process involves:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Identifying your priorities and financial goals </li>
        <li>Creating a budget document that outlines your expected monthly income and expenses </li>
        <li>Tracking your actual income and spending </li>
        <li>Making adjustments as needed to stay on track</li>
      </ol>

      <hr style="border:2px dashed #aa91f4; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;">

      <p><b>50/30/20 Rule</b>
      <br> The 50/30/20 rule is a simple budgeting strategy that can help you manage your finances effectively. It suggests allocating your after-tax income into three categories: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings. By following this rule, you can ensure you're prioritizing essential expenses, controlling discretionary spending, and building a strong financial foundation for the future.</p>
      <p><b><u>50% Needs</u></b>
      <br> Needs are the essential expenses you must pay for survival and daily living. This includes things you can’t live without, such as rent, utilities, and basic necessities. For college students, this might include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Rent or dorm fees</li>
        <li>Utilities (if not included in rent)</li>
        <li>Groceries</li>
        <li>Insurance and Healthcare</li>
        <li>Minimum debt payments, such as student loans or credit card payments</li>
      </ol>
      <i>If you're spending more than 50% of your income on needs, consider adjusting your lifestyle. You might downsize to a more affordable living situation, limit utility usage, or choose cheaper grocery options.</i>
      <p><b><u>30% Wants</u></b>
      <br> Wants are things you spend money on that aren't essential for survival but make life more enjoyable. For college students, this might include: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Dining out, snacks, or coffee from cafes</li>
        <li>Concert tickets, movies, or other entertainment</li>
        <li>Non-essential clothing or accessories</li>
        <li>Travel for vacations or weekend trips</li>
        <li>Upgrading to the latest phone, gaming console, or laptop</li>
      </ol>
      <i>Wants are the fun things that add enjoyment to life but can be adjusted depending on your financial situation. If you're on a tight budget, consider cutting back on some of these non-essential purchases.</i>
      <p><b><u>20% Savings</u></b>
      <br> It's important to set aside 20% of your income for savings and investments, even as a student. While it may be challenging, building up an emergency fund is essential in case of unexpected situations like losing a part-time job or dealing with a medical emergency. Here are some ways to save as a student:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Build an emergency fund for unexpected expenses</li>
        <li>Contribute to a retirement account like an IRA (if possible)</li>
        <li>Set aside money for future big purchases (e.g., a car, travel, or housing after graduation)</li>
        <li>Pay off any high-interest debt (such as credit card debt)</li>
      </ol>
        <i style="background-color: #c9bbf3;">By following the 50/30/20 rule, you can create a balanced approach to managing your finances, even on a student budget. It helps you stay on track with your essential needs, enjoy life, and save for your future!</i>

      <p><b>Avoid Unnecessary Expenses</b></p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Track Subscriptions</b>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Review Monthly Subscriptions: Regularly check your subscription services (e.g., streaming platforms, gym memberships, magazines). You may have services you no longer use or need. Consider canceling any subscriptions that aren't providing enough value.</li>
            <li>Use Subscription Management Apps: Apps like Truebill or Trim can help you track and manage your subscriptions automatically. These apps notify you of upcoming renewals and can even help you cancel subscriptions you no longer need.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Cut Back on Takeout Food</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Plan Meals Ahead: Planning meals in advance can help you avoid the temptation to order takeout. Having ingredients for quick, easy meals ready to go reduces the need to spend money on food delivery.</li>
            <li>Cook at Home: Cooking at home is often cheaper and healthier than ordering out. Try learning a few simple recipes or batch-cooking meals to save time and money throughout the week.</li>
            <li>Limit Ordering Out: If you do order takeout, set a weekly limit. This helps you enjoy takeout occasionally without it becoming a frequent habit.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Avoid Impulse Buys</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Make a Shopping List: Always go shopping with a list, and stick to it. Avoid browsing aimlessly, as it can lead to unnecessary purchases.</li>
            <li>Implement a 24-Hour Rule: If you feel the urge to buy something on impulse, wait 24 hours. Often, the desire to buy it will pass, and you’ll avoid making an unnecessary purchase.</li>
            <li>Unsubscribe from Retail Email Lists: If you receive constant promotions and sales notifications, unsubscribe from these emails. They can tempt you into making unnecessary purchases when you’re not actively planning to buy anything.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Evaluate Your Needs vs Wants</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Assess Purchases Carefully: Before making any purchase, ask yourself whether it’s something you truly need or just a want. This helps prevent buying items on a whim.</li>
            <li>Wait for Sales: If you need something but it’s not urgent, wait for discounts or sales instead of paying full price immediately.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Set a Budget for Discretionary Spending</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Allocate a Set Amount for “Fun” Purchases: Give yourself a specific amount each month to spend on non-essential items. This helps you stay within your budget while still enjoying occasional treats.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p><b>Understanding Loans</b></p>
      <p>Loans come in various forms, each designed to meet specific financial needs. Understanding the different types of loans can help you choose the right one for your situation. Here are the main categories:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Student Loans</b>
        <br>These loans are specifically designed for students to help cover the cost of tuition, books, and other education-related expenses. They usually offer lower interest rates and more flexible repayment options compared to other types of loans. Student loans can be federal (offered by the government) or private (offered by banks and financial institutions)</li>
        <li><b>Personal Loans</b>
        <br>Personal loans are unsecured loans, meaning they don’t require collateral. They can be used for various purposes, such as consolidating debt, funding home improvements, or covering medical expenses. Interest rates on personal loans can vary depending on your creditworthiness.</li>
        <li><b>Mortgagae Loans</b>
        <br>A mortgage is a loan specifically used to purchase real estate. The property itself serves as collateral, meaning the lender can take ownership of the property if the borrower fails to repay the loan. Mortgage loans typically have long repayment terms (15 to 30 years) and can have fixed or adjustable interest rates.</li>
        <li><b>Auto Loans</b>
        <br>An auto loan is used to finance the purchase of a car. Like a mortgage, the vehicle acts as collateral, meaning if the borrower fails to make payments, the lender can repossess the car. Auto loans typically have shorter repayment terms (3 to 7 years) and lower interest rates compared to personal loans.</li>
        <li><b>Credit Card Loans</b>
        <br>Credit cards are a type of revolving credit where you can borrow money up to a set limit. The loan is repaid through monthly payments, and if the balance isn’t paid off in full, interest is charged. Credit cards are generally an expensive way to borrow money due to high-interest rates.</li>
        <li><b>Home Equity Loans</b>
        <br>A home equity loan allows you to borrow money using the equity (the value of the home minus what is owed on it) in your property. This is a secured loan, meaning your home is at risk if you fail to repay. Home equity loans typically have lower interest rates than personal loans because the property serves as collateral.</li>
        <li><b>Payday Loans</b>
        <br>Payday loans are short-term, high-interest loans designed to cover urgent, small expenses until your next paycheck. These loans are typically due in full by your next payday, and failure to repay on time can lead to significant fees and a cycle of debt.</li>
        <li><b>Business Loans</b>
        <br>Business loans are used to fund the startup, expansion, or operation of a business. These loans can be secured (requiring collateral) or unsecured and typically come with higher loan amounts and longer repayment terms.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">Importance of paying off interest early</b>
      <br>Paying off interest early is crucial for several reasons, as it can significantly impact your overall financial health.</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><b>Reduces the Total Amount Paid</b>
        <br>When you pay off interest early, you're reducing the amount of interest that accrues on your loan or credit balance. Interest compounds over time, which means that if you only make minimum payments, you'll pay much more in interest in the long run. By paying early, you minimize the interest on the principal, which results in less total debt.</li>
        <li><b>Helps you Pay Off Debt faster</b>
        <br>By making early interest payments, you free up more of your monthly payment to go toward reducing the principal. This accelerates the process of paying off the loan. The faster you pay off the principal, the less interest you’ll owe, helping you achieve financial freedom sooner.</li>
        <li><b>Improves Credit Score</b>
        <br>Reducing your debt more quickly, including paying off interest, can positively impact your credit score. Lowering the total amount you owe improves your credit utilization ratio (the amount of credit you're using compared to your total available credit), which can help raise your credit score.</li>
        <li><b>Prevents the Debt from Snowballing</b>
        <br>Interest can quickly cause debt to grow if you're not paying it off. When you allow interest to accumulate without making extra payments, the balance can snowball, making it even harder to pay off over time. Paying it off early ensures the debt doesn’t increase beyond what you can manage.</li>
        <li><b>More Financial Flexibility</b>
        <br>The less money you owe in interest, the more financial flexibility you have. Paying off interest early can free up cash flow that you can put toward other savings, investments, or expenses. It gives you more control over your finances and reduces financial stress.</li>
        <li><b>Saves Money in the Long Run</b>
        <br>The most significant benefit of paying off interest early is the amount of money you save. By reducing the interest you owe, you’ll spend less over the life of the loan, which can be a significant amount depending on the interest rate and loan duration.</li>
      </ol>
      <hr style="border:2px solid #7f5af0; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
      <p><b>Banking & Credit Cards</b></p>
      <p>Managing your money as a student starts with having the right tools such as a bank account made for students and good credit habits. It's important to know how to pick the right account, use credit cards the right way, and stay away from money problems. This will help you have a strong and healthy financial future.</p>
      <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">How to Open a Student-Friendly Bank Account</b> </p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">A student-friendly bank account is made for students with limited income. These accounts often have no maintaining balance, low or zero monthly fees, and easy access through mobile apps. Some banks may also offer special perks like discounts or rewards for students.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">To open one, you just need a valid ID and proof of enrollment. You can go to a bank branch or apply online through banks such as UnionBank, BPI, PNB, and others.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Opening a student account is an important step in learning how to manage money wisely. It allows students to safely handle their daily expenses, avoid unnecessary fees, and develop good financial habits early in life.
        <br>Benefits of a student-friendly bank account:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It helps you avoid penalty fees and hidden charges.</li>
        <li>It encourages saving even with small amounts.</li>
        <li>It gives easy access to tools for tracking your spending.</li>
        <li>It teaches basic financial responsibility at a young age.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">Building Credit Responsibility (Do's and Don'ts)</b>
      <br>Building credit early helps you become financially independent and ready for adult responsibilities. A good credit score can help you rent an apartment, or even qualify for a job. Using a credit card wisely builds your score, while overspending or missing payments can lead to debt and limit future opportunities.</p>
      <b><u>Do's with Credit Card Usage</u></b>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Pay your balance in full and on time.</b>
          <br>Always pay the full amount due before the due date to avoid interest charges and late fees.</li>
          <li><b>Keep your credit usage low.</b><br>Try to use less than 30% of your credit limit to maintain a healthy score.</li>
          <li><b>Start with a student or secured credit card.</b><br>These are easier to get and are designed to help beginners build credit.</li>
          <li><b>Check your statements and track spending.</b><br> Be aware of where your money goes and look out for suspicious transactions.</li>
          <li><b>Set up auto-pay or reminders.</b><br>Automate payments or use alerts so you never miss a due date.</li>
        </ul>
      <b><u>Don'ts with Credit Card Usage</u></b>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Don't max out your card.</b><br>Using your full credit limit can hurt your score and show risky behavior.</li>
          <li><b>Don't spend more than you can repay.</b><br> Only use your card for what you can afford. Credit is not free money.</li>
          <li><b>Don't skip payments.</b><br>Late or missed payments can damage your credit and lead to extra fees.</li>
          <li><b>Don't apply for too many cards at once.</b><br>Multiple applications can lower your score through hard credit checks.</li>
          <li><b>Don't ignore your credit report.</b><br>Check it at least once a year to spot mistakes or signs of fraud</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Adulting 101</h2>
      <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">How to grocery shop on a budget 🛒</b> </p>
      <p><b>STEP 1: Review your grocery budget ahead of time.</b>
        <br> Calculate your spending limit without compromising other financial priorities. Monitoring your grocery budget spending lets you make necessary adjustment and guarantees that you don’t go over budget.
        </p>
        <p><b>STEP 2: Come up with a weekly meal plan.</b>
          <br> Help cut down on food waste and prevent needless purchases. You may save as much money as possible by organizing your meals around what you already have and what on sale.
        </p>
        <p><b>STEP 3: Make a grocery list before going to the store.</b>
          <br>To prevent impulsive purchases and maintain focus. You may cut down on unnecessary spending by making a list and only purchasing what you need.
        </p>
        <p><b>STEP 4: Use cash for groceries.</b>
        <br>To help you keep spending under control and stay within your budget, pay with cash for groceries. Cash payment can reduce wasteful spending and facilitate expenditure.
        </p>
        <p><b>STEP 5: Learn the Clean Fifteen and Dirty Dozen. </b>
        <br> To determine which produce is worth purchasing organic. This tactic enables you to save money on produce that has been exposed to fewer pesticides while prioritizing your expenditure on healthier selections.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>STEP 6: Buy generic instead of brand-name items.</b>
        <br> Since they usually charge less for the same quality. Although they cost a lot less, many store brand products are manufactured by the same companies as name-brand ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>STEP 7: Buy in bulk (sometimes).</b>
          <br> When it makes sense for the size of your household and saves money. Pay attention to perishable goods and only purchase large quantities of items that you will utilize before they go bad.
        </p>
        <p><b>STEP 8: Use coupons.</b>
          <br> To save money on groceries for things you already intend to purchase. To get the most savings, look for retail promos, cashback applications, and digital or print coupons.
        </p>
        <p> <b>STEP 9: Use rewards to your advantage.</b>
          <br> By purchasing groceries and taking advantage of their rebate programs, you can save money. Many grocery stores offer loyalty or reward programs that give you discounts based on how much you spend on groceries.
        </p>

        <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">Laundry and Clothing Care 👕 </b> </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Let's face it! Laundry may not be the most exciting part of adulting, but it’s one of the most important skills you’ll ever learn. From avoiding accidental disasters (like shrinking your favorite sweater) to saving money by making your clothes last longer, proper laundry care is a game changer. Let’s dive into three essential aspects of clothing care that will make your life easier and your wardrobe happier!</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>How to properly wash and dry clothes</b> 
            <br> Ever pulled out your favorite shirt from the washer only to find it ruined? Here’s how to make sure every wash is a success: </li>
            <ol type="a">
              <li><b>Sort Clothes:</b> Separate clothes by color (whites, darks, colors) and fabric type (delicates vs. sturdy materials). This avoids color bleeding and fabric damage. </li>
              <li><b>Choose Detergent Wisely:</b> Gentle detergents for delicate fabrics, and stronger ones for gym clothes and heavily soiled items.</li>
              <li><b>Temperature Matters:</b> Use <i>cold water</i> for bright colors and delicates. Use <i>warm water</i> for towels and sturdy fabrics (optional).</li>
              <li><b>Dry the Right Way:</b> Air dry delicate items to prevent shrinkage. Use the dryer for sturdier clothes but stick to low heat for synthetic materials.</li>
            </ol>
          <li><b>Reading Fabric Care Labels</b>
            <br> Those little tags on your clothes aren’t just there to annoy you, they’re your laundry cheat sheet! Understanding them can save your favorite pieces from disaster.
          </li>
          <u>Washing symbols</u> provides instructions on how to properly wash and care for garments. If there’s no washing symbol on a piece of clothing, don’t worry! You can still take care of it properly by following these general guidelines:
          <br><ul>
            <li><b>Identify the Fabric Type.</b> Check the texture and feel of the fabric.
            <br> <i>Cotton</i>: Typically durable and safe for machine washing. 
            <br><i>Silk or Wool</i>: Likely delicate and requires hand washing or dry cleaning.
            <br><i>Synthetic Fabrics</i>(e.g. polyester, nylon): Machine washable but best on a gentle cycle.
            </li>
            <li><b>Hand Wash for Safety</b>. If you’re unsure, hand washing is the safest option. Use lukewarm water and gently agitate the fabric.</li>
            <li><b>Drying Instructions</b>: Is it tumble dry safe, or does it need to hang dry? Follow the label to avoid damage.</li>
            <li><b>Ironing and Bleaching</b>: Only bleach if the label says it’s safe, and use the correct heat setting when ironing.</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>

        <p><b style="color:#7f5af0">Living with Roommates</b> 
        <br> Benefits of roommate living include financial savings, social connection, and shared duties. Setting boundaries and using practical conflict resolution strategies are essential for preserving a peaceful home life and minimizing arguments. In addition to improving communication and personal development, this arrangement creates a community of support that raises everyone standard of living with roommates.</p>
         <p><b>> Setting Boundaries</b>
          <br>Boundaries are essential to creating a cozy living space. This incluse talking about individual preferences for visitors, shared areas, cleanliness, and noise levels. Roommates can foster a polite environment that reduces miscommunication and possible disputes by outlining these boundaries precisely.</p>
          <p><b>> Conflict Resolution</b>
          <br> Clashes with roommates are bound to happen, but they don’t have to spiral into drama. Learning how to resolve conflicts calmly and respectfully is the secret to keeping the peace. </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Start with a Conversation:</b>
            <br>Sit down with your roommates early on to talk about expectations, cleaning schedules, shared expenses, and personal boundaries.
            <br>Use “I” statements to express concerns without blaming. For example, “I feel frustrated when dishes are left in the sink for days.”</li>
            <li><b>Respect Boundaries:</b>
            <br>Establish clear rules about what’s personal (e.g., food, belongings) and what’s shared to avoid misunderstandings.
            <br>Always ask for permission before borrowing anything, and knock before entering someone’s room.</li>
            <li><b>Address Issues Early:</b>
            <br>Don’t let small annoyances build up. Discuss concerns calmly as they arise instead of waiting for them to worsen.</li>
            <li><b>Ask for Help if Necessary:</b>
            <br>If tensions grow, bring in a neutral person (e.g., a mutual friend, family member, or landlord) to mediate and find a fair resolution.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>> Keeping your space clean and organized</b> 
          <br>Nobody wants to live in chaos. A clean and organized home isn’t just about appearances, it boosts your mood, reduces stress, and keeps everyone happy.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Establish a Practical Cleaning Schedule:</b>
            <br> Assign tasks fairly, like taking turns cleaning the bathroom or taking out the trash.
           <br> Use shared calendars or apps to keep track of everyone’s responsibilities.</li>
           <li><b>Keep Clutter Under Control:</b>
            <br> Make it a habit to tidy up immediately—whether it’s putting away shoes or washing dishes after meals.
            <br> Regularly go through shared spaces to prevent clutter from piling up.</li>
            <li><b>Optimize Storage Solutions:</b>
            <br>Utilize bins, shelves, and hooks to keep personal items organized and out of shared areas.
            <br>Label storage containers to make finding and returning items easier.</li>
            <li><b>Follow the "CLAYGO (Clean As You Go)" Habit:</b>
            <br>Clean up messes right after they happen, like wiping down counters or washing dishes immediately. This saves time and ensures a consistently tidy space.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><b>> Dealing with landlords and rental agreements</b>
           <br>When renting a home, the rental agreement and your relationship with the landlord must be carefully considered. In order to guarantee that both parties are aware of their right and responsibility, a well-written rental agreement specifies important elements including rent,due dates for payment, maintenance duties, and lease duration. A good landlord-tenant relationship is fostered and misunderstanding or conflicts are avoided with effective communication and awareness of one’s legal rights. </p>

      <h2>Basic Life Skills</h2>
      <div class="step-title">a. Personal Safety & Emergency Preparedness</div>
      <p style="text-indent:25px;">Emergencies can happen when you least expect them, even while you’re on campus and being caught off guard can make all the difference. That’s why as a college student being prepared isn’t just a good idea, it’s essential for your safety and peace of mind. Think about it: knowing exactly what to do, where to go, and how to protect yourself when something unexpected happens. By having a solid emergency plan, staying informed, knowing evacuation routes, and keeping essential supplies will help you stay in control. Don’t wait for a crisis to strike, take action now so you’re always one step ahead. </p>
      <h4>What is Emergency Preparedness?</h4>
      <p style="text-indent:25px;">Emergency preparedness is all about the steps you take to protect yourself before, during, and after a disaster. Whether it’s a natural disaster or a man-made emergency, being prepared ensures your personal safety in any situation.
        <br> Some examples are:
        <ul>
          <li>Natural Disasters: Floods, blizzards, tornadoes, earthquakes.</li>
          <li>Man-Made Disasters: Explosions, fires, chemical or biological attacks.</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Why Personal Safety and Emergency Preparedness Matters</p>
      <p style="text-indent:25px;">Being prepared for a crisis can mean the difference between loss and survival. Emergencies and disasters, from natural events to accidents and attacks, are a part of life. Ignoring their possibility increases risks and consequences. </p>
      <p style="color:#7f5af0">Benefits of having Personal Safety and Emergency Preparedness:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Preparation can limit or precent certain disasters</b> - Fireproofing, earthquake-zone building codes, flood control, security checkpoints, and emergency plans exist to prevent or reduce disasters. Proper planning and prevention can reduce a disaster’s impact, especially for vulnerable populations.</li>
        <li><b>Preparation can save lives</b> - Emergency preparedness is crucial for families, businesses, cities, and nations. Plans must address specific threats and the needs of vulnerable groups like the elderly and disabled.</li>
        <li><b>Preparation can reduce fears</b> - While traumatic events are inevitable, proper planning can reduce psychological distress by preventing unnecessary hardship and providing clear steps for safety, helping people act faster.</li>
        <li><b>Preparation can make it easier to recover</b> - Even with planning, disasters may result in loss. Emergency preparedness ensures losses aren’t catastrophic by backing up important documents, having leadership succession plans, and knowing where to relocate which helps recovery.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>CAMPUS SAFETY TIPS</h4>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Campus safety tips play a crucial role in creating a secure and welcoming learning environment. They provide students with the essential knowledge and skills needed to respond effectively in emergencies, which not only enhance their personal well-being but also helps ensure the safety of the entire campus community.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">EMERGENCY CONTACTS</b>
        <br>In an emergency, knowing who to call is essential. Having a list of important contacts ready can help you act fast when it really matters. <u>Here's how to stay prepared:</u>
          <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Save Important Numbers.</b>
            <br>Save the numbers for local emergency services (fire, police, ambulance), campus security, and health services on your mobile devices. These should be easily accessible to avoid wasted time in a crisis.</li>
            <li><b>Program "In Case of Emergency" (ICE) Contacts.</b><br>Add emergency contacts under the "ICE" label in your phone. These could include family members, close friends, or anyone you trust to assist in a crisis. Emergency responders can use these numbers to contact your loved ones if you are unable to do so.</li>
            <li><b>Plan Family Communication.</b><br>Agree on a neighborhood meeting place in case you are unable to contact your family or go home due to an emergency. In addition, select an out-of-town meeting location as a backup if local communications are down.</li>
          </ol></li>  
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">SAFE TRAVEL ROUTES</b>
        <br>Walking around campus should feel safe, and knowing the best routes to take can make a huge difference, especially at night. A little planning goes a long way in staying secure. <u>Here's how to plan ahead:</u>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Stop all activities immediately. Complete the internal departmental or class procedures that have been determined to be essential prior to emergency evacuation.</li>
            <li>Assess that all persons can evacuate the area. Department safety wardens, supervisors, laboratory managers and instructors are required to assure that everyone, including individuals with mobility limitations, have evacuated their area. Note: Evacuation plans for persons with disabilities must be made part of each department's documented emergency evacuation procedures.</li>
            <li>Follow EXIT signs to the nearest safe exit. Do not use elevators! Special care should be taken with some footwear, such as clogs, that could hamper rapid and safe descent.</li>
            <li>Use the stairs. Never use the elevator. Walk briskly, but do not run. Stay on the right in order to allow emergency response personnel clear access up the stairs, along the left side.</li>
            <li>Allow others to enter the stairwell. As you approach the landing of each floor, allow evacuees from that level to enter the stairwell.</li>
            <li>Steer clear of hazards. If evacuation becomes difficult via a chosen route, because of smoke, flames or blockage, re-enter the facility on a safe floor. Continue evacuation via the nearest safe exit route.</li>
            <li>Move away from the building. Once you have exited the facility, move at least 150 ft. away from the building and exit doors. Proceed to your Evacuation Assembly Area.</li>
            <li>Do not re-enter the building without an “all clear”. Do not, under any circumstances, re-enter the facility unless authorized by a FIU Police Officer, fire department personnel or until a recognized university authority broadcasts the "all clear" message.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>BASIC FIRST AID KIT & CPR</h4>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Why Having a First Aid Kit Matters</p>
      <p style="text-indent:25px;">Accidents and injuries can happen anywhere at any time. Keeping a first aid kit with you at all times can prevent minor illnesses from becoming major. It also helps reduce the severity of the injury and prevent the appearance of infection.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 25px;"><b>CPR or Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation</b> is an emergency lifesaving procedure performed when the heart stops beating. Immediate CPR can double or triple chances of survival after cardiac arrest.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">CPR should be used when you see someone who is unresponsive and is not breathing or only gasping. Having more bystanders trained in this simple skill can help save lives by putting more cardiac arrest victims within a few steps of lifesaving assistance.</p>
      <p style="color:#7f5af0; font-weight: bold;">Types of CPR</p>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Hands-Only CPR</u>: Hands-only CPR is an easy-to-learn skill that could save a life. It involves calling 9-1-1, sending someone for the AED if available and then giving continuous chest compressions. It only takes minutes to learn.</li>
        <li><u>Full CPR with Rescue Breaths</u>: While Hands-only CPR can be lifesaving, learning full CPR is still very important. Getting trained in full CPR – combinations of chest compressions and rescue breaths – will increase your confidence and may enable you to help in other types of emergencies. Full CPR is ideal for all ages, and especially for people who are more likely to experience respiratory emergencies such as children and infants.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="color:#7f5af0;"><b>How do you perform CPR?</b><br>Always remember C-A-B: Compressions, Airway, and Breathing</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><b>Compressions</b>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
          <li>Lay the person flat on their back on a firm surface.</li>
          <li>Place your hands in the center of the chest, one on top of the other.</li>
          <li>Keep your elbows straight and your shoulders over your hands.</li>
          <li>Push hard and fast, at least 2 inches deep, 100-120 compressions per minute (about the beat of "Stayin' Alive").</li>
          <li>Let the chest rise between compressions.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><b>Airway</b> - After 30 compressions, tilt the head back and lift the chin to open the airway.</li>
        <li><b>Breathing</b> - Pinch the nostrils shut and give two rescue breaths. Seal your mouth over theirs and breathe in until the chest rises. If the chest doesn’t rise, adjust the head and try again.</li>

      <h4>HANDLING EMERGENCY SITUATIONS (Fire Drills & Medical Emergencies)</h4>
      <p>Emergencies can be stressful, but knowing what to do can help you stay calm and take action. Here’s how to handle things like fire drills and medical emergencies with confidence.</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><b>FIRE DRILLS</b>
        <p>The purpose of a fire drill is to familiarize and reinforce proper evacuation routes and practices. The goal is to have the proper actions be an automatic response whenever fire alarms sound, so that everyone safely evacuates the area in an orderly manner. Fire drills are required annually for most facilities, and should be used to evaluate warning features and occupant knowledge. </p>
          <b>Steps to Conduct a Successful Fire Drill</b>
          <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Plan the Fire Drill</b>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
              <li><u>Set Clear Objectives</u>: Make sure the drill helps everyone evacuate quickly and safely, tests the fire alarm system, checks emergency exits, and assesses the response of safety officers.</li>
              <li><u>Schedule Wisely</u>: Choose a time that avoids peak hours to ensure maximum participation without disrupting normal activities.</li>
              <li><u>Notify Key Personnel</u>: Ensure fire wardens, safety officers, and local emergency services are informed ahead of time so they can be ready.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><b>Communicate with Building Occupants</b>
              <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li><u>Give Advance Notice</u>: Let everyone know about the scheduled drill so they can be prepared.</li>
                <li><u>Share Important Info</u>: Distribute evacuation maps, instructions, and training videos to make sure everyone understands their role.</li>
              </ul> </li>
            <li><b>During the Fire Drill</b>
              <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li><u>Activate the Alarm</u>: Make sure the fire alarm is loud enough for everyone to hear.</li>
                <li><u>Observe the Evacuation</u>: Watch how quickly everyone evacuates, check if there are any issues with the exits, and ensure everyone follows the procedures.</li>
                <li><u>Assist Others</u>: Fire wardens should help guide people, especially those with mobility issues, to the assembly area in a calm and orderly way.</li>
              </ul></li>
              <li><b>Post-Drill Review</b>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                  <li><u>Gather Feedback</u>:  After the drill, ask for input from participants and fire wardens to see what worked and what could be improved.</li>
                  <li><u>Evaluate Performance</u>: Look at how quickly people evacuated and if everyone followed the plan properly.</li>
                  <li><u>Update Plans</u>: Use the feedback to make any necessary improvements for future drills and update the emergency evacuation plan.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>MEDICAL EMERGENCIES</b>
        <p>When a medical emergency strikes, every second counts. Knowing how to respond quickly and calmly can help save a life in a crisis.
        <br> Before an emergency happens, know the quickest route to the nearest emergency department and keep emergency numbers posted at home and saved in your phone. Everyone should know how to call these numbers. Also, know which hospital your healthcare provider uses, and wear a medical ID if you have a chronic condition. Older adults, especially those living alone, should consider a personal emergency response system. </p>

    <div class="step-title">b. Time Management & Organization</div>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Time management and organization are one of the life skills that enable people to plan ahead, 
    stay on top of assignments, and maximize their day. These abilities support juggling obligations in one's personal, professional, and academic lives. To effectively stay focused, lower stress levels, and accomplish your goals, you must be deliberate about how you spend your time and arrange your surroundings. </p>
    <p style="color:#7f5af0; font-weight: bold;">Why is it important?</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">There are a lot of events, deadlines, and expectations associated with college life. It's simple 
      to become overwhelmed if you don't prepare ahead and organize yourself properly. By effectively allocating your time to the things that are most important, time management skills enable you to work smarter, not harder. Maintaining organization provides you greater control over your personal and academic lives, lowers worry, and increases productivity.</p>
    <p style="color:#7f5af0; font-weight: bold;"> Time Management isn't just about schedules.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Making time for the things that are important in life is the goal of time management, not 
      making the most of every minute of your day. This covers academics as well as hobbies, sleep, socializing, and taking care of oneself. Organizing your day makes you feel more balanced and less overwhelmed, which increases productivity and lowers stress.
      </p>
    <h4>What are the benefits of Time Management and Organization?</h4>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li><b>Btter Academic Performance</b>: Effective time management and task organization increase your chances of meeting deadlines, getting ready for tests ahead of time, and producing higher-quality work. Better scores and a higher academic status result from this.</li>
      <li><b>Reduced Stress and Anxiety</b>: Procrastination and missed deadlines can cause anxiety, which can be avoided by knowing what has to be done and when. You can approach assignments with confidence and calmness if you have a well-organized plan that helps reduce mental overload.</li>
      <li><b>Clear Direction and Motivation</b>: Time management provides your day structure and purpose. When you know what you’re working toward and why, it’s easier to stay motivated and prevent the sense of being “lost” or unproductive.</li>
      <li><b>Better Attention and Decision-Making</b>: You may choose more wisely where to focus your efforts when you have a clear picture of your priorities. Additionally, it reduces distractions so you may focus more intently on a single job at a time.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>HELPFUL TOOLS FOR STAYING ON TRACK</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><b><span style="color:#aa91f4;">Eisenhower Matrix:</span></b><br>Do you want to quit feeling overburdened by never-ending tasks? A useful technique for 
        classifying activities into four groups is the Eisenhower Matrix:
        </li>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><b><u>Important and Urgent</u>: Do it right away</b> <br>- These are urgent chores that require your immediate attention. Like studying for an exam tomorrow, finishing a project ahead of schedule, or managing an emergency, they are both necessary and time-sensitive. If you don't take immediate action, there can be dire repercussions. Thus, finish them first!</li>
        <li><b>Schedule it if it's <u>important but not Urgent</u></b><br>- Although you don't have to finish these activities immediately, they are crucial to your long-term success. This covers tasks like organizing your notes, working on a passion project, or reviewing for the test the following week. It's simple to put them off, but don't! To address them before they become urgent, put them on your to-do list or calendar.</li>
        <li><b>Ask someone else to handle it if it's<u>urgent but unimportant</u></b><br>- Although they don't truly require your personal attention, many jobs seem urgent. They could divert your attention, such as responding to messages, holding pointless meetings, or making impromptu requests that aren't truly your responsibility. Ask for assistance, utilize a template, or automate it if you can. Your time may now be spent on the things that truly count.</li>
        <li><b>Remove it since it is <u>not urgent or important</u></b><br>- These are distractions. They don’t help you improve and they aren’t time-sensitive. Things like binge-watching, endless scrolling, or superfluous tasks go here. It’s okay to relax, but if it’s eating up time you could use for something worthwhile, try to minimize or limit it.</li>
      </ol>
      <li><b><span style="color:#aa91f4;">Bullet Journaling</span></b>
      <br>An all-in-one, adaptable solution for tracking, reflecting, and planning. Bullet journaling can be an effective visual aid for maintaining concentration, whether you're writing down daily tasks or creating monthly objectives. Additionally, it allows your imagination to go wild, transforming planning into a soothing routine.</li>
      <li><b><span style="color:#aa91f4;">Google Drive</span></b>
      <br>Your school’s digital backpack. File storage, group work sharing, document collaboration, and 
      device access is all possible. Ideal for keeping backup copies, project data, and study materials in one safe location. </li>
      <li><b><span style="color:#aa91f4;">Physical Planners</span></b>
      <br>Physical planners provide a concentrated, screen-free method for people who would rather be 
      more hands-on with their organization. Manually recording your plans can improve memory recall and give them a more deliberate sense. Having daily to-do lists, weekly agendas, and monthly overviews in one location makes it simpler to handle obligations without feeling overburdened. Additionally, adding stickers, creative layouts, or color-coding to your planner might make it more fun and inspiring for you personally.      
      </li>
    </ol>
    <hr style="border:2px dashed #aa91f4; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;">
    <h4 style="color:#7f5af0">HOW TO CREATE A DAILY ROUTINE?</h4>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><b>Make a list of your daily activities.</b>
        <br>Start with the things that you already do every day. Then add things that you want to do every day. Think of how the things you already do can trigger you to do the things you want to do. This will help you put the pieces of your routine together.</li>
      <li><b>Set a goal for your routine.</b>
        <br>The ultimate goal you want to achieve helps you decide which tasks to include in your routine. Do you want your routine to help you become more productive? To get fit? To live a healthier life? Once you know your routine's purpose, you'll know how to arrange your day to satisfy that purpose.</li>
      <li><b>Break tasks into smaller chunks that are easier to achieve</b>
        <br>Breaking up large tasks into manageable chunks helps you get more done. Take complex tasks and list their components by breaking these up, you can get a lot done without even thinking about it.</li>
      <li><b>Determine the time you need to complete the tasks in your routine.</b>
        <br>Each of the individual tasks in your routine will take you an average amount of time. In general, try to give each task just a little longer than it actually takes you to complete. Add those padded estimates together to figure out how long your entire routine should take. That way, you'll know when you can get it done without rushing or feeling stressed.</li>
      <li><b>Start your routine at the same time every day.</b>
        <br>Choose a distinct block of time for daily routines, such as your morning routine and your bedtime routine. Designating these specific times for your routine helps you structure your day and make sure you have time to do the things you need to do.</li>
      <li><b>Add less frequent tasks to your routine gradually.</b>
        <br>You likely have some tasks that you need to do but you don't need to do them every day. Make a list of tasks that you need to do weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. Then, you can add those into your routines where you have time and it makes sense to do so.</li>
      <li><b>Follow your routine for at least 2 months to make it a habit.</b>
        <br>It does take some time to turn a routine into a habit so that you can reap all of the benefits. Once the different parts of your routine become habitual, you'll do them without thinking and that takes a lot of stress and pressure off your mind.</li>
      <li><b>Forgive yourself when you slip up.</b>
        <br>Making mistakes is just par for the course when you're trying to engrain a new habit into your daily routine. While it's possible that you'll take to it right away, remember that change isn't linear. If you believe that your routine is good for you and is worth doing, you'll ultimately get it down.</li>
      <li><b>Keep track of your progress to gauge whether your routine is working.</b>
        <br>At the end of each week, look back at how well you've followed your routine and whether you're making progress towards your goals. If you're having a harder time with some parts of your routine than others, figure out why.</li>
      <li><b>Make changes to your routine as needed.</b>
        <br>After your routine has become habitual, it's easy to feel stuck in it. If you become overly rigid about your routine, you'll keep doing it long after it's stopped actually serving your needs. Treat your routine as fluid and subject to change, rather than as something that's set in stone.</li>
    </ol>

    <hr style="border:2px solid #7f5af0; margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
    <div class="step-title">c. Health Insurance & Medical Care</div>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">There is more to college life than just coursework and due dates. Taking care of your body 
      and mind is also important. When you're ill, stressed, or in need of assistance, knowing how health insurance works and where to obtain reasonably priced care can make a significant difference. You feel more in control, worry less about costs, and concentrate more on remaining healthy throughout your trip when you are well-informed.
      </p>
    <p style="color:#7f5af0; font-weight: bold;">What is Health Insurance and why is it important?</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">When you become ill, get hurt, or need a checkup, health insurance helps shield you from 
      excessive medical bills. Because your insurance covers a portion of the costs rather than the full amount, healthcare is cheaper. Knowing how this operates can help you take charge of your wellbeing once you start college and start making decisions on your own. You may concentrate more on your studies and less on unforeseen medical bills because you won't have to worry about money when you need medical assistance.</p>
    <h3>HEALTH INSURANCE OPTIONS FOR YOU!</h3>
    <b style="color:#7f5af0">1. PhilHealth</b>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), provides health insurance 
      coverage to all Filipino citizens. For students below 21 years old, they can be registered as dependents of their parents who are PhilHealth members, allowing them to enjoy benefits without additional premiums. This classification as dependent members ensures that young students have access to necessary medical services.</p>
    
    <b style="color:#7f5af0">2. School-provided Healthcare</b>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Students in the Philippines have access to medical services within or connected to the school because of the health benefits offered by several colleges. For example:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li><b>Our Lady of Fatima University (OLFU)</b><br>- Our Lady of Fatima University (OLFU) collaborates with The Fatima University Medical Center (FUMC) to offer staff and students medical service discounts. For instance, staff, instructors, and students at OLFU and FUMC are eligible for a 25% discount on laser treatments and other medical services.</li>
      <li><b>University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB)</b><br>- The University Health Service (UHS) offers a variety of healthcare services to UPLB students.  They can take advantage of free outpatient consultations, which enables them to get dental and medical advice without incurring extra fees.  Furthermore, UHS provides expert consultations in fields like orthopedic surgery, infectious illnesses, and internal medicine.  Students can take advantage of discounted prices on laboratory testing, X-rays, ultrasounds, dental care, and other medical procedures for diagnostic purposes.  With reduced costs for psychiatric consultations, mental health support is also given priority, guaranteeing that students may get expert mental health treatment when they need it. </li>
      <li><b>University of Santo Tomas (UST)</b><br>- UST provides all-inclusive medical care to its students through UST Health Service. In addition to routine, emergency, and specialized healthcare, this facility offers the Thomasian community activities aimed at disease prevention and health promotion. The UST Health Service provides laboratory and diagnostic services as well as yearly physical examinations in partnership with the UST Hospital. Through this collaboration, students' access to a wide range of medical treatments is guaranteed, improving their general health while they are enrolled in classes.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr style="border:2px dashed #aa91f4; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 25px;">
    <h3>BUILDING YOUR OWN STUDENT HEALTH KIT</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Became ill when you live alone? What a nightmare! No one will prepare you soup or give 
      you medicine, just you, your throbbing headache, and the regret that you didn't prepare for this. Because of this, a student health kit is essential! Avoid rushing when you're already feeling like a human puddle by stocking up on these necessities:</p>

      <h2>Unusual/Hidden Tips for Surviving College Life</h2>
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">a. ACADEMIC TRICKS <br>Saving Grades and Sanity in College</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Surviving college isn't just about attending the classes and taking exams, usual routines are fine but outsmarting the system a little and making learning might help you. Overloaded syllabi, confusing lectures, and surprise quizzes might be a real struggle and using smart, unconventional strategies will give you an unfair advantage in academics without burning yourself out. These hidden academic tricks will help you study faster, retain information better, and save time and effort.</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Create a Reminder Group Chat.</b>
        <br><b>Problem:</b> Group studies waste time because people just chat.
        <br><b>Trick:</b> Create a group study system where sending notes, recorded voice summaries, and any important points in a chat are included with no unnecessary messages. This way, you will help each other with no distractions.</li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Find yourself an Invisible Study Partner.</b>
        <br><b>Problem:</b> Studying alone can be difficult, but group studies can be distracting too.
        <br><b>Trick:</b> Find a buddy who's serious about learning and can study side by side without talking. A presence of another focused student keeps you stay on track and less likely to be distracted.</li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Befriend the staff in the library.</b>
        <br><b>Problem:</b> The best books are always borrowed before you can get them.
        <br><b>Trick:</b> If they like you, they might tip you off when important books are returned, or even hold a copy for you. It’s like having a secret VIP pass to knowledge.</li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Sitting next to an overly enthusiastic blockmate</b>
        <br><b>Problem:</b> You don’t understand anything in class, but asking the professor is too scary.
        <br><b>Trick:</b> Sit next to the class nerd who answers every question. Their explanations are usually clearer than the lecture itself, and best of all they can’t resist explaining things.</li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Problem with staying awake in class</b>
        <br><b>Problem:</b> You’re falling asleep in class, and the professor notices.
        <br><b>Trick:</b> Suddenly raise your hand and ask "Sir/Ma’am, could you explain that last part again? I feel like there’s a deeper connection I’m missing." your professor will love the enthusiasm and explain. Meanwhile, you secretly wake yourself up.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">b. FINANCIAL TRICKS<br>Saving Money and Sanity in College</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">College isn’t just about passing exams, it's also about surviving financially when your wallet is hanging by a thread. Budgeting apps and frugality advice are great, but sometimes, you need hidden money-saving tricks that no one talks about. These rare financial hacks will help you stretch every peso, dodge unnecessary expenses, and even make extra cash without selling your soul to capitalism.</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Search for Unlimited Internet Connection</b>
          <br><b>Problem:</b> Mobile data is expensive, and you always need WiFi.
          <br><b>Trick:</b> Take note of every spot on campus or nearby cafés with free, fast WiFi. Some fast-food chains reuse the same passwords every day, and some buildings have open faculty networks. </li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Acquire Scholarships or Grants</b>
          <br><b>Problem:</b> You need extra money, but you don’t qualify for most scholarships.
          <br><b>Trick:</b> Go to your school’s scholarship office and ask about any available grants, discounts, or financial aid programs. Sometimes, they have lesser-known allowances (like free books or part-time campus jobs) that no one applies for.</li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Selling Reviewers</b>
          <br><b>Problem:</b> You need money but don’t have time for a real job.
          <br><b>Trick:</b> Find a classmate who always forgets assignments, readings, or reviewers, then offer to organize their files or summarize notes for a small fee. Some lazy but rich students will gladly pay P50-P100 per reviewer just to save themselves the effort.</li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Look for Free E-books Online</b>
          <br><b>Problem:</b> Textbooks are expensive, and PDFs are hard to find.
          <br><b>Trick:</b> Some libraries have digital access to textbooks they just don’t tell students. Ask the librarian if your school subscribes to online academic databases where you can download free e-books instead of buying them.</li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Volunteer for Free Pass</b>
          <br><b>Problem:</b>You want to go to concerts, fairs, or school events but can’t afford tickets.
          <br><b>Trick:</b> Volunteer as a staff or usher for the event, most organizers let volunteers in for free and even give free food after the event.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">b. SOCIAL & DORM TRICKS<br>Surviving College without Awkwardness and Dorm Nightmares</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">College can be 50% academics, 50% social survival, and 100% learning how to live in a tiny space with strangers. You could either suffer through awkward interactions, annoying roommates, and expensive dorm problems, or you can use these rare social and dorm tricks to outsmart the system. Here are hidden yet extremely effective hacks to make friends, avoid drama, and live comfortably in college dorms without spending a lot.</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Pay Attention to what you Lend</b>
          <br><b>Problem:</b> Dorm mates keep borrowing your stuff but never return it.
          <br><b>Trick:</b> If someone asks to borrow something, ask them for something first, example: “Sure, but can I borrow your charger for a sec?”. If they refuse, they will feel guilty and probably won’t ask again. If you lend something, write their name down, people return things faster when they know they’re being tracked.</li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Silent Respect</b>
          <br><b>Problem:</b> You don’t want to be friends with your roommate, but you also don’t want drama.
          <br><b>Trick:</b> Be neutral but polite, say good morning, keep your space clean, and never touch their stuff. You don’t have to be besties, but mutual respect prevents unnecessary tension. If they play loud music, put on noise-canceling headphones instead of starting a fight.</li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Food as the Universal Language</b>
          <br><b>Problem:</b> You want to make friends fast in a new dorm.
          <br><b>Trick:</b> On the first few days, bring a pack of chips, candy, or instant coffee and casually offer some to your roommates or roommates. Food is the ultimate icebreaker.</li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Scooping a Little</b>
          <br><b>Problem:</b> You always run out of detergent, and borrowing feels awkward.
          <br><b>Trick:</b> Some dorm laundromats leave detergent dispensers unlocked, scoop a little when needed instead of buying new packs every time.</li>
        <li><b style="color:#aa91f4">Improve Communication</b>
          <br><b>Problem:</b> You keep running into dorm mates, but the small talk gets awkward.
          <br><b>Trick:</b> Instead of the usual “Kumusta?” ask something weird like “What’s the best meal you’ve ever eaten in your life?” Weird questions = better convos.</li>
